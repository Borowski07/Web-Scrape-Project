VITAMINS AND MINERALS  Humans must obtain vitamins and minerals from food since our bodies can't produce them. This is why they are also referred to as essential nutrients.  Vitamins are organic compounds made by plants or animals, and minerals are inorganic, existing in soil or water.  Vitamins are necessary for energy production, immune function and other Functions. Meanwhile, minerals play an important role in growth, bone health, fluid balance and several other processes.  When you eat, you consume the vitamins that plants and animals created or the minerals they absorbed. It's best to eat a variety of foods to get enough vitamins and minerals.

",      ,"Utilizes a revolutionary method of enhanced Vitamin C delivery – Liposomal Encapsulation Technology - designed to help your body absorb more Vitamin C.Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that can help protect cells from the damage caused by harmful free radicals.Perfect Vitamin C support to help maintain a healthy immune system. Can assist with muscle repair for those with active lifestyles. Vitamin C supports collagen production for healthier, firmer skin.Vegan, Non GMO. Formula contains NO: Gluten, Dairy, Sugar, or Hexane. Zone/Paleo Diet Friendly. To take: Squeeze packet into 1 to 3 ounces of water or a favorite cool beverage and consume in one gulp. The product will not dissolveNOTE: Packaging may vary between both vertical and horizontal packaging. Please see secondary image for examples. Rest assured all packaging is fresh stock.Most ordinary forms of oral Vitamin C, tablets, capsules, powders, liquids and even Vitamin C from your diet, may not be processed and absorbed efficiently by your body. As a result, much of this Vitamin C is never transferred into your bloodstream and even less of it makes it into your cells. When you take 1,000 milligrams or more of regular oral Vitamin C, more than half of it is passed as waste by your body.1 Until now... Unlike pills and powders, which are not absorbed efficiently, Lypo Spheric products use liposomes made from Essential Phospholipids to maximize absorption. Phospholipids are primary building blocks of the cellular membrane: the thin, protective wall around each cell in your body. The phospholipid wall functions as a skin for each cell, keeping things in or out. While your body can make some phospholipid compounds on its own, others must be supplied by your diet. These are called essential phospholipids. Lypo C gives you 1,000 milligrams of Vitamin C AND 1,000 milligrams of Essential Phospholipids in each packet, including Phosphatidylcholine, an important phospholipid required for maintaining a healthy cardiovascular, reproductive, immune, and nervous system. 1Source: NIH Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Vitamin C Note: These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Maintaining optimal levels of serotonin and dopamine translates into fewer mood swings. Since it functions as a secondary messenger for these neurotransmitters, inositol is vital for balancing one’s mental well-being.Clean and Proven Formula: Amplicell’s potent formula of 2000mg Myo-Inositol with high potency is the optimal dosage you need to reap the unique benefits of this ingredient. Recommended daily dosage is four capsules per day with water (two capsules for the first two weeks) or as recommended by a healthcare professional. These fertility supplements for women are Gluten-free, Preservative-free, and Vegan.We are a passion-driven company dedicated to developing top-notch nutritional products with a simple goal: to help you live to the fullest. Our supplements are validated by stringent scientific standards and go through multiple levels of authentic verification procedures. We create solutions for various age groups across numerous health aspects. Myo-inositol is a potent ingredient that promotes hormonal balance, supports ovarian function, helps maintain egg quality, and helps improve cognitive focus and energy. Having enough inositol in the system can help women maintain period regularity, reduce acne breakouts, and hinder unwanted hair growth. Myo-inositol can help women improve egg quality, help keep their menstrual cycle on track, and support a proper balance of key hormones. Myo-inositol affects the processes that create neurotransmitters (serotonin and dopamine). By increasing the levels of inositol, the brain can transmit the message more efficiently. Inositol supplementation can aid the processing of glucose (sugar) into energy your body can use, thus reducing insulin resistance. Myo-Inositol can help reduce brain fog and the overall sensitivity women experience during their premenstrual syndrome. It also helps supports the ratio of testosterone and insulin - hormones involved in ovulation. Myo-Inositol supplementation can promote normal ovulatory function and regular monthly periods. Our formula ensures you’re getting the right dose of this unique ingredient (2000mg Myo-Inositol). The recommended daily intake is four capsules per day with water (two capsules for the first two weeks) or as recommended by a healthcare professional. Our capsules are vegan and responsibly sourced.

",      ,"fix Helps maintain energy level*Supports nervous system function*Promotes proper heart function*Free from manufacturing agents, coatings, colorings, binders, fillers and release agentsNo Magnesium Stearate, Silica, Dioxides, Sulfates, Starch, Soy, Nuts or MilkVitamin B1, also known as thiamine, was one the first organic compounds to be recognized as a vitamin. Like all the other B complex vitamins, it is water soluble and not stored in the body. Rather, excess amounts of B1 will be excreted. And like the other B vitamins, it helps the body convert the foods we eat into usable fuel to maintain life-sustaining functions. Vitamin B1 must be in adequate supply for aerobic energy production to take place. This is the process in which sugar (glucose) is converted into usable energy. Vitamin B1 also plays roles in the nervous system where it promotes the healthy development of myelin sheaths, the material that surrounds and protects most nerves. Insufficient vitamin B1 intake can result in degradation and damage to the myelin sheath. Symptoms such as pain, prickly sensation, and deadened nerves may be linked to a vitamin B1 deficiency.* Thiamine is also needed for the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that relays messages between the nerves and the muscles. Acetlycholine's importance in maintaining muscle tone makes vitamin B1 a significant nutrient in maintaining proper heart function because the heart is a muscle whose performance is vital to human life.*",,2023-04-17,Vitamins  Supplements-page-3-product-29.png,"DR.CLARK STORE’  LEADER IN PURITY Established by Dr. Clark’s Family in 1993  Vitamin Bl  Dietary Supplement 500 mg | 100 Capsules  : VITAMIN BI (THIAMINE)  ® ©.

Help promote calcium absorption and support vitamin levels with this easy-to-take, vegan spray.Multiple Benefits: Calcium, Vitamins D and K2 are vital for bone health. Vitamin D is beneficial as it aids the body’s absorption of Calcium and Phosphorus and supports immune function. Vitamin K2 is also crucial for strong bones, but also for modulating Calcium — it activates osteocalcin which binds Calcium to bone; and it helps keep Calcium out of artery walls, where it doesn’t belong.Vegan Formula: Per Serving (30 Drops): 15 mcg (600 IU) Vitamin D3 (as Cholecalciferol), 30 mcg Vitamin K2 (as Menaquinone-7). Other Ingredients: Organic Olive Oil. Our D3 is sourced from wild-crafted, non-GMO, vegan Lichen. Lichen is a slow-growing, simple organism, known for growing on trees or rocks. Our K2 is sourced from Natto, a traditional Japanese food made from fermented soybeans.Easy-to-Take Liquid Spray: No more hard-to-swallow pills or capsules! Shake well before use. Once daily, take directly by mouth. This product was formulated for children, ages 1 to 3 years old. Shake well before use.

Vitamin D is beneficial as it aids the body’s absorption of Calcium and Phosphorus and supports immune function. Vitamin K2 is also crucial for strong bones, but also for modulating Calcium — it activates osteocalcin which binds Calcium to bone; and it helps keep Calcium out of artery walls, where it doesn’t belong. It’s been shown that children between 1 and 3 years of age who received Vitamin D supplementation had not only higher Vitamin D levels, but also higher Calcium and Phosphorus. As well, it’s important to include this essential nutrient into your child’s diet as cases of rickets, a condition that can be caused by Vitamin D deficiency resulting in the softening and weakening of bones, tend to be reported during the second year of life.
