A higher purity NMN powder means higher absorption and bioavailability, resulting in a more potent longevity supplement.Fully stabilized: NMN typically needs to be kept cold (fridge or freezer) because of it's short shelf life.

At 99.7% standardized nicotinamide mononucleotide, our NMN supplement capsules provide the purest, most potent anti-aging nutrients available.Setting a new standard for purity: To ensure that you are getting the highest quality NMN supplement pills, each batch is tested for quality and purity both during and after manufacturing.Quality, first, and foremost: In order to meet the highest regulatory standards, Toniiq products are produced in a GMP-certified and NSF-approved state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Miami, USA.

", ,"Product Type: Health Personal CarePackage Quantity: 1Assists healthy red blood cell production and supports cognitive function.May help in reducing the risk of deficiency in susceptible individuals.Australian NaturalCare Activated B12 1000mcg is essential for healthy nervous system function and helps maintain a healthy cardiovascular system. We’ve all heard about vitamin B12, but what about activated B12? What’s the difference? Vitamin B12 is an essential water-soluble vitamin required for healthy nervous system, immune and cognitive function, healthy red blood cell and energy production, as well as being essential for fat, carbohydrate and protein metabolism. Vitamin B12 is also quite unique in that it undergoes various steps in the body to enable it to be fully utilized. Currently, the most common vitamin B12 supplement is known as cyanocobalamin (pronounced cy-ano-co-bala-min). You may know it as Vitamin B12. It was understood that this form of vitamin B12 had to be converted by the body into the active form of B12 before it could be used. Activated B12 is known scientifically as mecobalamin (pronounced me-co-bala-min) or co-methylcobalamin (pronounced co-meth-ill-co-bala-min). Co-methylcobalamin is the bioavailable and metabolically active form of vitamin B12. It doesn’t need to be converted. Activated B12 1000mcg is ready for your body to use and carry out its very important functions. Furthermore, as we age, the enzymes controlling how we utilise B12 can become compromised, resulting in improper activation. Activated B12 1000mcg is the form metabolically preferred and utilized by the body. Activated B12 1000Mcg may assist with: - Energy production. - Maintaining nervous system health. - Supporting cardiovascular system health. -Maintain Healthy immune system function. - Maintaining healthy cognitive function. - The production of red blood cells. - Proper carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. - Reducing the risk of deficiency in susceptible individuals.","Take one tablet daily, or as advised by your healthcare provider.

Pharmaceutical medications are not the only treatment available for behavioral over-activity. Nutritional supplements are often recommended for individuals with various forms of behavioral over-activity, including hyperactivity, fidgeting, aggression, and impulsivity. Manifestations of behavioral over-activity is quite common in people with neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as in the general population. These manifestations can include: Episodes of aggression, Fidgeting/stereotypic movements/hyperkinesis, Hyperactivity Impulsivity, Seizures. These manifestations are very common in autism, and in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Behavioral over-activity is generally treated by medications, whether in autism, ADHD, other neurodevelopmental disorders, or neurotypical individuals. However, medications are not the only treatment available. In particular, nutritional supplements are often recommended for individuals with various forms of behavioral over-activity. Supplements should be considered for the treatment of behavioral over-activity in the following settings: Mildly-affected individuals who potentially do not warrant a medication trial. Families wishing to use natural therapies first, and medications if indeed warranted. Individuals who are very sensitive to psychotropic medications. Families that are reluctant to give psychotropic medications due to concern regarding adverse effects. Individuals who have failed trials with psychotropic medications due to lack of effect or significant adverse effects.

Vitamins are organic compounds made by plants or animals, and minerals are inorganic, existing in soil or water.  Vitamins are necessary for energy production, immune Function and other functions. Meanwhile, minerals play an important role in growth, bone health, fluid balance and several other processes.  When you eat, you consume the vitamins that plants and animals created or the minerals they absorbed. It's best to eat a variety of foods to get enough vitamins and minerals.

",      ,"LABO Nutrition NeuroREGAIN is a natural formula made with Scallop-derived PLASMALOGEN extracted from scallop, and is naturally bound with DHA to effectively support brain function. Scallop-derived PLASMALOGEN is the only natural ingredient validated by clinical trials for its effectiveness on Alzheimer’s and dementia patients. NeuroREGAIN is a safe dietary supplement with 92% pure plasmalogen and without chemical modification. It is not a drug and no prescription is required.REPLENISH INSUFFICIENT PLASMALOGEN IN THE BODY. Plasmalogen is a type of phospholipids found most abundantly in the brain. Research showed that the decline of plasmalogen affects brain performance, especially in plasmalogen-deficient seniors. Hence, plasmalogen restoration therapy via NeuroREGAIN supplementation is of the utmost importance to help regain healthy cognitive function.SUPPORT OPTIMAL BRAIN HEALTH VIA VARIOUS PATHWAYS. Plasmalogen is research proven to support restoration & improvement of brain health via different means: √ Support neuroregenesis (growth of new brain cells) √ Protect against brain cell death √ Protect brain cells from oxidative stress √ Suppress neuroinflammation & accumulation of amyloid β proteins which can damage brain cells √ Support learning, memory, concentration & other cognitive functions.CLINICALLY VALIDATED ON PATIENTS WITH BRAIN DETERIORATION. The discovery of Scallop-derived PLASMALOGEN shines a glimmer of hope for patients with brain health degeneration. Intensive clinical studies confirmed positive results of improvement in cognitive functions (memory, time orientation, place orientation etc.), behavioural symptoms (hallucination, delusion, depression, sleep disorder), facial and emotional response (more sensitive & responsive to their surroundings).NATURAL, HIGHLY SAFE & PURE. NeuroREGAIN is a dietary supplement formulated with 92% purity & natural Scallop derived PLASMALOGEN without chemical modification. No wheat, gluten, yeast, milk derivative or preservatives. Safe and suitable for long-term consumption for optimal brain performance. Protect against neuronal cell death. Suppress neuroinflammation and accumulation of amyloid beta proteins which can damage nerve cells in the brain. For more information, visit https://plasmalogen.meTHE MOST PROMISING SOLUTION TO SUPPPORT REJUVENATION OF BRAIN FUNCTIONS & MEMORY Plasmalogens are a type of phospholipid present in human tissues and found most abundantly in the brain. Their levels in the body increase from the foetal stage, peak in the 30s and begin to decrease thereafter. The decline of plasmalogen affects brain functions, especially in plasmalogen-deficient seniors. Several studies have shown that plasmalogen levels are lower in brain tissue and blood serum of patients with brain deterioration compared to healthy individuals. Plasmalogen helps protect the brain from oxidation and manage the formation of amyloid plaques which are responsible for cognitive decline. Furthermore, it also supports neurogenesis (growth of new brain cells) and healthy memory & cognitive functions. Hence, plasmalogen restoration is critical to maintain optimal brain function. NeuroREGAIN is a brain health supplement formulated with Scallop-derived PLASMALOGEN, a natural extract corroborated by clinical trials to support improvements in cognitive function, behavioral symptoms, facial and emotional response in patients with degeneration of brain function. Developed by a panel of researchers in the universities of Japan, NeuroREGAIN’s patented extraction process and proprietary nano-encapsulation technique ensure precise and targeted delivery of high purity Scallop-derived PLASMALOGEN for brain health support. It should be noted that consuming large amounts of plasmalogen-rich food like scallop will not achieve the same effects and absorption efficiency as plasmalogen extracted through specialized technology. For more information, visit https://plasmalogen.me NeuroREGAIN is highly recommended for: Adults; especially middle-aged and elderly Individuals with poor memory or mental clarity Individuals with brain health concerns, or high risk of brain health degeneration Highly-stressed individuals who are prone to brain fatigue Maintaining and improving brain health","This product is extracted from scallop and is manufactured in a GMP facility that also processes soybean.
