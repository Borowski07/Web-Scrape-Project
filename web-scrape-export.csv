The macula is part of the retina at the back of the eye. Itis responsible for our central vision, most of our colour vision and the fine detail of what we see. The cells of the macula are particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage. Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Zinc and Copper alll play a role in the protection of cells from oxidative stress. Lutein and Zeaxanthin are found in high concentrations in the macula, where they are known as the macular pigment. The macular pigment is thought to protect the eye by acting as an antioxidant and by absorbing damaging ‘blue’ light.

VITAMINS AND MINERALS  Humans must obtain vitamins and minerals From Food since our bodies can't produce them. This is why they are also referred to as essential nutrients.  Vitamins are organic compounds made by plants or animals, and minerals are inorganic, existing in soil or water.  Vitamins are necessary for energy production, immune Function and other functions. Meanwhile, minerals play an important role in growth, bone health, fluid balance and several other processes.  When you eat, you consume the vitamins that plants and animals created or the minerals they absorbed. It's best to eat a variety of foods to get enough vitamins and minerals.
