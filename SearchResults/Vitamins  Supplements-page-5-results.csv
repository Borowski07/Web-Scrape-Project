The Calcium Traffic Cop

Recent clinical studies have shown that Vitamin K2 acts as a traffic cop when it comes to directing calcium where it needs to go to make sure it does its critical work - strengthening your bones and teeth.

Why is Vitamin K2 Important?
Vitamin K2 is virtually absent in our modern day diets. K2 deficiencies occur in as little as a week when your diet is low on K2 rich foods . . . and the result is calcium starts accumulating in the soft tissues and arteries and is not getting to the bone, where it's desperately needed.

Do I need More Than One Form of Vitamin K
Yes . . . That’s because Vitamin MK-7 and MK-4 serve different vital functions necessary for your good health.
- MK-4 is found in the brain and plays a significant role in supporting normal brain functions.
- MK-7 is a bioactive form of K2 found naturally occurring in Natto and causes the carboxylation of specific bone proteins required for building strong bones. Recent studies also indicate MK-7 promotes cardiovascular health.

",     ,"THE PERFECT PAIR - It's true. Vitamins K2 & D3 were simply meant to be together. Most people know the benefits of Vitamin D (maintaining strong bones, immune system support, healthy muscle function, etc.), but many dont realize that Vitamin D NEEDS Vitamin K2 to maximize its benefits. So, if youre fighting Vitamin D deficiency, you need to supplement Vitamin K2 as well. Zhou Nutritions K2+D3 has you covered- adding just the right amount of each Vitamins superior form for maximum results.STRONG BONES- Vitamin D3 (termed the sunshine vitamin') is the same biologically active form of Vitamin D you get from the suns UVB rays. With this complex, youll get the benefits without the burn. D3 helps your body absorb the all-important calcium, and Vitamin K2 (as MK-7, the form of K2 with the highest bioavailability) directs the calcium to your bones instead of your joints and arteries, where too much calcium could be problematic.HEALTHY HEART - If youve heard the term hardening of the arteries, its referring to calcification. Calcification occurs when calcium has been absorbed by the body, but deposited in arteries instead of bones. This formula not only promotes the proper absorption of calcium with D3, but the correct distribution to your bones where you need it most.ONLY THE BEST- At Zhou Nutrition, we take pride in providing just the right amount of high-quality ingredients for maximum results- no more, no less.The synergistic K2 + D3 is no exception. Just one small, easy-to-swallow veggie capsule per day provides 5000 iu of D3 and 90 mcg of K2 as MK-7, helping you support strong bones and a healthy cardiovascular and immune system.WHAT SETS US APART At Zhou, we use only the highest-quality ingredients in an FDA certified facility following GMP (good manufacturing practices). Plus, we test everything at our lab in Utah, so you can be confident that youre fueling your body with the very bestK2D3 is your go-to vitamin D supplement to support your heart, bones, muscles, and mood. Vitamin D3 is THAT important, and it needs vitamin K2 to maximize all those benefits. With an estimated 1 billion people worldwide experiencing vitamin D deficiencies, supplementing is an effective solution—especially if you get less sun exposure during those winter months. Our premium formulation packs a punch with 5000 IU per serving and the most bioavailable form of K2 available (MK-7). Our Non-GMO formula has zero gluten, wheat, soy, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts and peanuts so you can trust that what you’re fueling your body with is clean and effective",Take 1 vegetable capsule with food once daily or as directed y your healthcare professional.,2023-04-17,Vitamins  Supplements-page-5-product-27.png,"IMMUNE+MOOD  vi SUPPORT* V |  SUPPLEMENT FACTS  Serving Size: 1 Capsule Servings Per Container: 60  Amount Per Serving % DV Vitamin D3 (as Cholecalciferol) 125 mcg 625% Menaquinone (MK-7) 90 mcg bag “Daily Value (DV) not established.

51,"Core Med Liposomal Vitamin C Softgels 1000mg/dose - Quali®-C Vitamin C (Non-GMO) - USA Made - Immunity Support, Collagen Booster Supplement - Non-GMO Non-Soy … (3 Month)",https://www.amazon.com.au/Core-Liposomal-Vitamin-Softgels-1000mg/dp/B07CLD93Z5/ref=sr_1_234?keywords=Vitamins+%26+Supplements&qid=1681625849&sr=8-234,Core Med Science,Amazon US,B07CLD93Z5,"Vitamins & Supplements
",       ,"Why Is Our Liposomal Vitamin C Product More Expensive Than Others? – It is because our product contains 100% non-GMO Scottish Vitamin C vs. 42.5% Vitamin C in the other products that sell “fat soluble” vitamin C like Ascorbyl Palmitate. Vitamin C is Ascorbic Acid, as naturally found in fruits. “Fat soluble” vitamin C is a Synthetic Food Preservative.“Fat Soluble” Vitamin C Does Not Mean Liposomal – “Liposomes” are microscopic spheres that envelop vitamin C at their center with Phospholipid Complex (PC), the same building block as cell membranes. Liposomes enhance absorption, but you need a lot of PC to make them. We use 350 mg of non-GMO Phospholipid Complex, but check other product labels that don’t list the amount separately – it may be too little to make the liposomes that increase vitamin C absorption in the first place.Where Does Our Vitamin C Come From? – Most of the vitamin C comes from one place (you can guess where) because it’s cheap. We made our liposomal vitamin C to use ourselves, so you can bet we sourced the purest vitamin C available, Quali-C non-GMO vitamin C from Scotland. And our non-GMO sunflower Phospholipid Complex comes from Spain.Benefits Based On Science – We only use Ascorbic Acid (Ascorbate), because that is what scientific evidence shows is vitamin C. Benefits include proper collagen formation for smooth, bright skin, healthy gums, strong bones, joints and blood vessels. Ascorbic Acid also contributes to a strong immune system, normal functioning of the nervous and cardiovascular systems, antioxidant protection of cells from free radicals, stress resilience, energy metabolism, increased iron and calcium absorption.Honesty And Trust – We don’t add up all of the ingredients and call them “Vitamin C Complex” to seem like you’re getting more vitamin C. We combine 1000 mg of Vitamin C with 350 mg of non-GMO phosphatidylcholine complex employing a proprietary manufacturing process that leads to natural liposome formation. It would take more than 2200 mg of “fat soluble” vitamin C to match our dose. This products is non-GMO, Gluten, Soy and Dairy Free, and is made in a cGMP certified facility here in the USA.Liposomal Vitamin C Softgels contain ascorbic acid Vitamin C 1000mg per serving (3 softgels = one serving = 1000 mg,). This liposomal vitamin C is the softgel version of our popular liquid liposomal vitamin C. Softgels are easier to transport and do not require refrigeration like liposomal vitamin c liquid. There is also no flavor with softgels as there is with the liquid version. The high quality of liposomes is achieved by using a refined Phospholipid Complex (PC) derived from non-GMO sunflower lecithin. Our product also contains Quali-C, a form of Scottish Vitamin C, instead of the cheaper Vitamin C other products use. Like liposomal glutathione, vitamin C is essential in maintaining an adequate immune response. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant which protects cells against aging damage caused by free radicals. It provides natural anti-inflammatory support and may assist in lowering melanin production potentially resulting in a whitening effect. In addition, vit C is a critical factor in collagen (skin, bones, ligaments, blood vessels) production. Vitamin C is also a mandatory co-factor in the production of adrenalin for healthy adrenal stress responses and neurotransmission. Vitamin C also assists in the manufacturing of l-carnitine which has lipotropic effects carrying fat into mitochondria for energy production. The Liposomal technology present in this product allows for vitamin C to be encapsulated (trapped) in microscopic protective spheres of essential fats (PC complex) which allow much higher absorption than plain Vitamin C and also decrease stomach irritation. The essential fats are phospholipid “PC complex” molecules which in themselves serve to increase Choline levels and theoretically enhance acetylcholine neurotransmitter levels. The softgel capsule is gelatin based (bovine, non-Vegan).",,2023-04-17,Vitamins  Supplements-page-5-product-52.png,"COre  Med Science  “iat LIPOSOMAL VITAMIN C SOFTGELS a ‘C =  <&|  -ChinafreCSualizC 1000mg/ dose +Non-GMO Vitamin C (Scotland) . +Non-GMO Sunflower Lipids (Spain)  270 SoFTGELs DIETARY SUPPLEMENT  Supplement Facts Serving Size: 3 softgels Servings per Bottle: 90  N01 (oly Valu) rot established  OTHER INGREDIENTS: Gelatin capsule (gelatin glycerin purified water, caramel) yellow beeswax, MCT oil.

Vitamin D must be taken with adequate amounts of both calcium and magnesium supplementation. When calcium levels are low (due to insufficient vitamin D and calcium intake), the body activates the parathyroid gland, which produces PTH (parathyroid hormone). This hormone kick starts vitamin D hormone production and assists removal of calcium from the banes to be used in more important functions such as neutralizing body acidity.
