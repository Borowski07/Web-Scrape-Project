",       ,"* HIGH ABSORPTION VITAMIN C * High doses of regular ascorbic acid Vitamin C is poorly absorbed by the body, and the excess is flushed out as waste. Liposome technology greatly improves the bioavailability and stability of this water-soluble vitamin by wrapping it inside a lipid layer. This also reduces the risk of gastric discomfort, a common side effect of ascorbic acid. More importantly, this improved bioavailability allows you to take advantage of everything this essential vitamin offers!* SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN HEALTH BENEFITS * Vitamin C may be best known as an antioxidant and immune system booster*, but its benefits go way beyond that! Vitamin C is a cofactor in Collagen production*, meaning without Vit C, there would be no Collagen. Additionally, Vitamin C also helps reduce fatigue*, aids in energy production*, and may even help improve your mood*. Moreover, Vitamin C helps with non-haem iron absorption* - perfect for vegans and vegetarians who can’t get Iron from meat.* DRY FORM LIPOSOMES * We use special liposomes formulated from coconut oil powder (standardized to 50% medium chain triglycerides or MCT) and sunflower seed lecithin. The coconut oil + sunflower lecithin combo protects the vitamin from oxidation and shields your digestive tract from Vitamin C’s natural acidity!* SUITABLE FOR VEGETARIANS & VEGANS * Our Liposomal Vitamin C capsules use no other ingredients apart from Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid, Ascorbyl Palmitate), our plant-based phospholipid complex and veggie capsules. Our Vitamin C immune system support supplement uses no dairy, milk, fish, eggs, or soy. If you are pregnant or nursing, are taking medications, or have any pre-existing medical conditions, consult with your physician before taking.* UNBEATABLE QUALITY & MONEY BACK GUARANTEE * Our Liposomal Vitamin C immune support supplement is manufactured at an NSF GMP registered facility in the USA.

But not everyone’s eating a healthy and well-balanced diet. And Vitamin C supplements aren’t created equal either. “Regular” Vitamin C supplements (the non-liposomal kind) are bioavailable, but only up to a certain dose (less than 200mg daily according to the NIH). The excess is eliminated as waste. Also, Vitamin C is water-soluble, making it inherently unstable and fragile.
