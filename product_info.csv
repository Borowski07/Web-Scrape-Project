It is also absorbed much better than generic K2 MK7Not Like other K2 Supplements - Most K2 supplements contain little to no All-Trans K2. Since the benefits from K2 are derived solely from the All-Trans form many K2 supplements are merely placebos providing little to no benefit.Don't Take Vitamin D3 without All-Trans K2 MK7: Taking D3 without an All-Trans K2 can cause dangerous increases in serum calcium levels and may induce short-term hypercalcemiaMaximum Absorption K2 D3 Vitamin Supplement: Liquid D3 K2 Drops are absorbed better than capsule or softgel alternatives.Made in the USA, Gluten Free, Non Gmo, Third Party Tested; Double Wood's Patented K2 D3 Drops are Made in the USA, contain no gluten, are non-gmo, and Third party tested for purity and potencyVitamin D plays a key role in the immune response. D deficiencies are associated with increased susceptibility to infections. But high dose D3 administration – like often suggested beneficial for immune health – can induce short‑term hypercalcemia, a transient increase in serum calcium levels. Although vital for the human body, calcium can have deleterious effects when not properly regulated. Its deposition in blood vessels or other soft tissues, such as elastic fibers in the lungs, can lead to damages. Vitamin K2 activates the calcium‑binding proteins that prevent calcium deposition in soft tissues and incorporate it to the bone matrix. Several studies have shown vitamin K2, like vitamin D3, to act as an anti‑inflammatory agent by downregulating several metabolic pathways involved in inflammation and cytokine release. Together as the Perfect Pair, vitamins D3 with K2 support healthy immune and inflammatory responses. Double Wood's Patented K2 MK7 drops with D3 are made in the USA, Gluten Free, Non-Gmo, and Third Party tested for Potency. Each bottle is 1Fl Oz and contains 30 servings. Each serving contains Vitamin D3 5000 iu and (125mcg) and 200mcg of a special, patented for of K2 MK7 that is <99% all Trans form called K2Vital.","As a dietary supplement, take 1 ML per day with or without food.
