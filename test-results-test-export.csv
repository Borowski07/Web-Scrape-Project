Why Effervescents?

Vitamin C	
Bottle Hydration	
Bottle Effervescent
They're convenient
Nearly 40% of Australians cannot swallow tablets or capsules which means our VÖOST range provides a quick and easy alternative in effervescent form.

They’re hydrating
You naturally consume more water with effervescent tablets due to the fact they are dissolved in 200ml of water.

They’re delicious
We’re all about the taste! VÖOST effervescents come in a range of fruity flavours and provide a healthy alternative to sugary drinks when that afternoon sweet craving hits.

They’re reliable
VÖOST effervescents contain premium quality ingredients and the effervescent nature of the product means that it delivers an on-point, reliable dose of the active ingredients.

A higher purity NMN powder means higher absorption and bioavailability, resulting in a more potent longevity supplement.
Fully stabilized: NMN typically needs to be kept cold (fridge or freezer) because of it's short shelf life. Our NMN comes in a completely shelf-stable non-refrigerated form and is packaged and sold in black sealed bottles that block light, moisture, and oxygen to ensure maintained and maximum potency
A key active ingredient: Nicotinamide Mononucleotide has amazing health benefits. However, purity has always been a major challenge for this super-nucleotide; something most other nmn supplements don’t provide as it requires an extra step (and expense) in the manufacturing process. At 99.7% standardized nicotinamide mononucleotide, our NMN supplement capsules provide the purest, most potent anti-aging nutrients available.
Setting a new standard for purity: To ensure that you are getting the highest quality NMN supplement pills, each batch is tested for quality and purity both during and after manufacturing.
Quality, first, and foremost: In order to meet the highest regulatory standards, Toniiq products are produced in a GMP-certified and NSF-approved state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Miami, USA.
