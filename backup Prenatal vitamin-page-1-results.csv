This balanced complex includes 23 essential nutrients to support fertility and a healthy pregnancy, reduce tiredness and fatigue, and support the normal functioning of the immune system.

Includes 400 ug of folic acid, to support normal maternal tissue growth in pregnancy and normal blood formation. Supplemental folic acid intake increases maternal folate status. Low maternal folate status is a risk factor in the development of neural tube defects in the developing foetus.

Also provides:

Iron for normal energy yielding metabolism, normal cognitive function and a reduction in tiredness and fatigue.

B vitamin complex to help the normal functioning of the nervous system, normal psychological function and normal energy yielding metabolism.
Zinc which supports normal fertility and reproduction, normal DNA synthesis and normal immune function.

Suitable for vegetarians and vegans.

*Carotenoids are found in colourful vegetables and have many nutritional qualities. Beta carotene is found in carrots whilst spinach is rich in lutein.
One of the benefits of Beta Carotene is that the body can use it to manufacture Vitamin A, if required. If the diet is providing adequate levels of Vitamin A, this conversion will not occur. For this reason, the NHS actually suggests Beta Carotene as a source of vitamin A for pregnant women.
Vitamin A is an essential nutrient required for normal iron metabolism, maintenance of the immune system and normal skin as well as laying a role in cell specialisation. This makes carotenoids an ideal addition to a pregnancy multivitamin, as a risk free way of providing vital nutrients.",,2023-04-17,Prenatal vitamin-page-1-product-12.png,"= wie | =/s  Bi rrr reces  Ei HEGRE B ES he lal ad  5 leg iy 7” BESS SHSsseoe% Eee EE ae IO a ae,  =  = a* a8 E  MULTI-NUTRIENT fin  a & ty i  ———————— fond splat tate saree beled etna.

Maximize how you move and how you think? Of course you do! Then you should consider Freshfield Vegan Omega-3 Supplements. Omega-3s are essential fatty acids used by multiple systems in your body. Your body can’t produce Omega-3 on its own, so you have to get it from food or a supplement. This is where a vegan diet can get challenging. While omega-3s can be found in seeds and nuts, it’s important to make sure you are getting them from the right source. Foods such as pumpkin seeds, walnuts and flax contain the omega-3, ALA (alpha linolenic acid). But this is not the only omega-3 you’re looking for. ALA can convert to DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), but at an extremely low rate – around 5%. For non-vegans, eating seafood can be a great way to make sure you are getting DHA and DPA. Sadly, it comes with certain risks: the contamination of our oceans greatly increases the chance for accumulation of mercury, PCBs, and pesticides.",,2023-04-17,Prenatal vitamin-page-1-product-14.png,"| —] = y i  OCEAN SAVING OMEGA™  wy  Better Than Fish Oil  This Omega-3 DHA supplement contains the same nutritional benefits of fish oil but unlike fish oil is sustainable, guaranteed to be free of ocean toxins like mercury, and will NEVER give you fish burps.

", ,"Product Type: Health Personal CarePackage Quantity: 1A Balanced Formula That May Be Useful During Times Of Increased Nutrient RequirementsParticularly Beneficial For People Whose Diets Are Lacking Some Of The Essential NutrientsAustralian NaturalCare Multi Vitamins & Minerals consists of a well-balanced formula that supports the maintenance of general health, immune system and may be useful during times of increased dietary demand. Tired or lacking energy? You may not be consuming enough vitamins and minerals. Revitalise by topping up your daily diet with Multi Vitamins & Minerals, a comprehensive formula aimed at improving your micronutrient status and helping you establish a foundation for optimal nutrition. This well-balanced combination of nutrients may be particularly beneficial for people whose diets are low in fruit and vegetables and for those who are tired, busy or under pressure. We all do our best to eat well, but many of us don’t manage to do so every single day. Here are three of the most common reasons to consider taking a daily multi to support your health and wellbeing: 1. You don’t eat enough fruit or vegetables: Alarmingly, a whopping 93% of Australians don’t eat the recommended 5-6 serves of vegetables every day, and around half don’t consume the recommended two servings of fruit. While taking a multivitamin can’t replace a balanced diet, it may help to overcome occasional nutritional shortfalls. 2. You drink lots of tea, coffee, soft drinks or alcohol: Coffee and tea may inhibit your absorption of nutrients such as iron, while soft drinks may promote the excretion of others, including magnesium. Similarly, excessive alcohol may adversely affect your nutritional status (for example, reducing levels of vitamin B1). 3. You’re dieting: While achieving a healthy body weight is vital to good health, low-calorie diets and skipped meals can also make it difficult to consume the vitamins and minerals you need.","Take one tablet daily with food, or as advised by your healthcare professional.",2023-04-17,Prenatal vitamin-page-1-product-50.png,OLE EE  1C ed avi é Australian NaturalCare Gs  MULTI VITAMINS & MINERALS  Supports general health and wellbeing  a  Ssanv  100 FILM COATED TABLETS AUSTL 13077
