VITAMINS AND MINERALS  Humans must obtain vitamins and minerals from food since our bodies can't produce them. This is why they are also referred to as essential nutrients.  Vitamins are organic compounds made by plants or animals, and minerals are inorganic, existing in soil or water.  Vitamins are necessary for energy production, immune function and other Functions. Meanwhile, minerals play an important role in growth, bone health, fluid balance and several other processes.  When you eat, you consume the vitamins that plants and animals created or the minerals they absorbed. It's best to eat a variety of foods to get enough vitamins and minerals.

Help promote calcium absorption and support vitamin levels with these easy-to-take, unflavored drops. Help promote calcium absorption and support vitamin levels with this easy-to-take, vegan spray.Multiple Benefits: Calcium, Vitamins D and K2 are vital for bone health. Vitamin D is beneficial as it aids the body’s absorption of Calcium and Phosphorus and supports immune function. Vitamin K2 is also crucial for strong bones, but also for modulating Calcium — it activates osteocalcin which binds Calcium to bone; and it helps keep Calcium out of artery walls, where it doesn’t belong.Vegan Formula: Per Serving (30 Drops): 15 mcg (600 IU) Vitamin D3 (as Cholecalciferol), 30 mcg Vitamin K2 (as Menaquinone-7). Other Ingredients: Organic Olive Oil. Our D3 is sourced from wild-crafted, non-GMO, vegan Lichen. Lichen is a slow-growing, simple organism, known for growing on trees or rocks. Our K2 is sourced from Natto, a traditional Japanese food made from fermented soybeans.Easy-to-Take Liquid Spray: No more hard-to-swallow pills or capsules! Shake well before use. Once daily, take directly by mouth. This product was formulated for children, ages 1 to 3 years old. Shake well before use. Once daily, dispense up to 1 mL or 30 drops (approx. 1 Pump*) directly into child's mouth, or add to food or drink.For Most Lifestyles: USDA Organic Vegan Vitamin D3+K2 (MK-7) Liquid Spray by MaryRuth’s for Toddlers is Non-GMO, Vegan, Dairy Free, Nut Free, Gluten & Wheat Free, Soy Free, Corn Free, Nightshade Free, Sugar Free, Made in a GMP Facility, No Artificial Colors, Formulated for Toddlers, Ages 1 to 3!Most people are familiar with the importance of Calcium for toddlers’ growing bones, but vitamins D and K2 are also vital for bone health, as well as proper Calcium absorption! Vitamin D is beneficial as it aids the body’s absorption of Calcium and Phosphorus and supports immune function. Vitamin K2 is also crucial for strong bones, but also for modulating Calcium — it activates osteocalcin which binds Calcium to bone; and it helps keep Calcium out of artery walls, where it doesn’t belong. It’s been shown that children between 1 and 3 years of age who received Vitamin D supplementation had not only higher Vitamin D levels, but also higher Calcium and Phosphorus. As well, it’s important to include this essential nutrient into your child’s diet as cases of rickets, a condition that can be caused by Vitamin D deficiency resulting in the softening and weakening of bones, tend to be reported during the second year of life. And, did you know our Vitamin D3 (as cholecalciferol) is the same form of this vitamin that your child’s (and your) body naturally produces when exposed to sunlight?

We pride ourselves on quality, which is why all bottles come with a 1-year guarantee, produced right here in the USA.Not getting enough B12 is very common in humans and it's not only due to lack of intake, but can also be from improper absorption from your body. We've come to the conclusion that taking vitamin B12 in liquid form - rather than pill, capsule or even an energy drink - is best because the liquid is able to mix with the saliva to break away from food or other healthy snacks and allow it to bind with other proteins. This allows the B12 to travel to our cells where it's most needed. Vitamin B12 is one of the most complex of all the vitamins and research confirms its critical necessity to human health. Vitamin B12 is integral to normal, healthy energy metabolism in all cells of the body. Methylcobalamin is the most prevalent bioactive coenzyme form of B12 to support detoxification and the central nervous system. Whether you might be getting the proper B12 levels through your food or not, we can never have too much B12 to truly be our best at all times.

",      ,"SUPPORTED BY SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH - In the body, Meso-Zeaxanthin (“eye vitamin”) is found only at the very centre of the macula of the eye. The macula of the eye is responsible for our central vision, enabling us to see fine detail clearly – essential for activities like reading and driving. Meso-Zeaxanthin protects the macula by acting as a powerful antioxidant, neutralising harmful free radicals and absorbing damaging ‘blue’ light from exposure to smartphones, television and computer screens.WHY YOU SHOULD BOOST YOUR LEVELS OF MESO-ZEAXANTHIN: Dietary sources of Meso-Zeaxanthin can only be found in small quantities in very specific foods such as shrimp and the skin of certain fish, meaning obtaining Meso-Zeaxanthin from diet alone is ineffective, especially for the elderly where nutrient absorption is inefficient and those who are on a vegan diet. Supplementation with Vision Defender MZ solves this problem, providing optimum strength Meso-Zeaxanthin.PERFECT COMPLEMENT TO LUTEIN SUPPLEMENTS – Already taking a vision supplement containing lutein but not Meso-Zeaxanthin? Taking an AREDS2 formula such as Vision Defender AMD eye supplement? Enhance the power of your lutein product with the addition of Vision Defender MZ. Meso-Zeaxanthin complements and works together with lutein but is 'missing' in many eye supplements. Add this key antioxidant carotenoid nutrient for maximum eyecare support. Why risk your precious eye health and eyesight?PREMIUM QUALITY, VEGAN AND VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY – Vision Defender MZ is made in the UK using top-grade ingredients to strict GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) standards in MHRA inspected facilities, so you can be assured that this is a superior quality eye supplement. Specially made to be suitable for vegan and vegetarians, all ingredients are from vegetable source and is free from artificial colours, flavours, lactose, gluten and GMO. Cruelty-free: Not tested on animals.TRUST AND BENEFIT FROM THE SPECIALISTS - The trusted Vision Defender range of products has been specially developed by qualified health care professionals to improve the health and vision of your eyes.

In the body, Meso-Zeaxanthin is found only at the very ‘centre of the macula of the eye. The macula of the eye is responsible for our central vision, enabling us to see fine detail clearly — essential for activities like reading and driving. Meso-Zeaxanthin protects the macula by acting as a powerful antioxidant, neutralising harmful free radicals and absorbing damaging ‘blue’ light. Dietary sources of Meso-Zeaxanthin can only be found in small quantities in very specific foods such as shrimp and the skin of certain fish, meaning obtaining Meso-Zeaxanthin from diet alone is ineffective. Supplementation with Vision Defender MZ solves this problem, providing high strength Meso-Zeaxanthin,  For more information, visit VisionDefender.co.uk  DIRECTIONS: Take ONE (1) capsule daily or as directed by your healthcare practitioner.

The Calcium Traffic Cop

Recent clinical studies have shown that Vitamin K2 acts as a traffic cop when it comes to directing calcium where it needs to go to make sure it does its critical work - strengthening your bones and teeth.

Why is Vitamin K2 Important?
Vitamin K2 is virtually absent in our modern day diets. K2 deficiencies occur in as little as a week when your diet is low on K2 rich foods . . . and the result is calcium starts accumulating in the soft tissues and arteries and is not getting to the bone, where it's desperately needed.

Do I need More Than One Form of Vitamin K
Yes . . . That’s because Vitamin MK-7 and MK-4 serve different vital functions necessary for your good health.
- MK-4 is found in the brain and plays a significant role in supporting normal brain functions.
- MK-7 is a bioactive form of K2 found naturally occurring in Natto and causes the carboxylation of specific bone proteins required for building strong bones. Recent studies also indicate MK-7 promotes cardiovascular health.
