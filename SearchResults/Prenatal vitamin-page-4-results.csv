Post-delivery, hormones and estrogen levels drop. You're left with lackluster skin or an uneven skin tone, known as melasma.

What's more, breastfeeding can lead to dehydration. Coupled with the whirlwind of the newborn stages (i.e., exhaustion and stress), skin begins to age more rapidly.

Superfood Skin Glow Gummy helps pick up the slack when all we can focus on is our little one's comfort.

SUPEROOD GUMMY POWERS
These watermelon-flavored superfruit vitamins for women contain Beet Root, Acerola Cherry, Acai Berry, Mango, Papaya, Peach, Banana, Goji Berry, Strawberrry, European Gooseberry, and Pomegranate.

This impressive group of superfruits helps skin stay hydrated and vigilant against free radicals. The result? You bring back that wonderful pregnancy glow!

Every NatureCity product is manufactured in the United States of America by some of the best manufacturers in the business. No cheap substitutes are used in any products – quality guaranteed.When vitamins were first discovered, they were isolated from food. Scientists did this so they could study the individual vitamins and minerals – not so they could take them as supplements.

During World War II, the need for nutrition of soldiers overtook the need for remaining true to nature, giving rise to cheap synthetic vitamins. Unfortunately, after the war ended, the food and supplement industry stuck with lab made synthetic vitamins instead of reverting back to food sources. Till this day, most vitamin supplements are made with synthetic vitamins.

Doing this ignores what scientists have known for a long time - vitamins and minerals are most effective in their natural plant form, surrounded by their co-factors and co-nutrients.

Until recently, finding a cost effective food based multi vitamin was near impossible. If you look closely at most whole food multivitamins, they aren’t made from food at all – they’re either the same old synthetic vitamins combined with plant extracts, or they are fermented in a lab.

With TrueMulti, you’re getting vitamins that come from actual plants, fruits and other botanicals grown in soil.

As important you get the natural nutritional co-factors that make the vitamins and minerals work more efficiently in your body – just like you get from food. In addition to supporting absorption into the body, these plant based nutrients may be more gentle on the stomach.

Since you’re probably taking a multivitamin to make up for or insure against a food shortcoming, doesn’t it make sense that the nutrients in your multivitamin should also come from food?",,2023-04-17,Prenatal vitamin-page-4-product-45.png,"i NatureCity’  TrueMulti  Plant Based Multivitamin  Dietary Supplement 30 Vegetarian Capsules  COL  Supplement Facts Serving Size: 1 capsule Servings Per Container: 30  Amount Per Serving _% Daily Value  —————————— ——————————_————_—_—_—_— Vitamin A (from Organic Food Blend, 150 mex 17%  Vitamin C (from Organic Food Blend and 90 mg 100% Organic amla fruit extract)  Vitamin D (as vitamin D3 cholecalciferol from 20 meg 100% organic algae) (VegD3°)  Vitamin E (from Organic Food Blend) 33.5 mg 223% Thiamin (from Organic Food Blend, 12.5 m 1,042% Riboflavin (from Organic Food Blend, 12.5 mg 962% Niacin (from Organic Food Blend, 17.5 m 109% Vitamin B6 (from Organic Food Blend. 25mg 1.471% Folate (from Organic Food Blend) 200 meg DFE 50% Vitamin B12 (as methylcobalamin) 250 meg 10,417% Biotin (from Organic Food Blend) 50 meg 167% Pantothenic acid (from Organic Food Blend) 30m, 600% Calcium (from Organic Food Blend, 2.5mg <1% Magnesium (from Organic Food Blend) 1.25 mg <1% Chromium (from Organic Food Blend) 0.5 meg 1% Potassium (from Organic Food Blend) 10 mg <1%  Organic Food Blend [organic guava leaf extract 500 mg  (Psidium guajava), lemon peel extract (Citrus limon), sesbania  leaf extract (Sesbania grandiflora), amla fruit extract (Emblica officinalis),  holy basil leaf extract (Ocimum sanctum) and annatto seed extract (Bixa orellana))  Organic amla fruit extract (Emblica officinalis) 80 mg  * Daily value not established.
