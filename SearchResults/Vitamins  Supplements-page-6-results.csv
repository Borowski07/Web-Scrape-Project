",       ,"Why Is Our Liposomal Vitamin C Product More Expensive Than Others? – It is because our product contains 100% non-GMO Scottish Vitamin C vs. 42.5% Vitamin C in the other products that sell “fat soluble” vitamin C like Ascorbyl Palmitate. Vitamin C is Ascorbic Acid, as naturally found in fruits. “Fat soluble” vitamin C is a Synthetic Food Preservative.“Fat Soluble” Vitamin C Does Not Mean Liposomal – “Liposomes” are microscopic spheres that envelop vitamin C at their center with Phospholipid Complex (PC), the same building block as cell membranes. Liposomes enhance absorption, but you need a lot of PC to make them. We use 350 mg of non-GMO Phospholipid Complex, but check other product labels that don’t list the amount separately – it may be too little to make the liposomes that increase vitamin C absorption in the first place.Where Does Our Vitamin C Come From? – Most of the vitamin C comes from one place (you can guess where) because it’s cheap. We made our liposomal vitamin C to use ourselves, so you can bet we sourced the purest vitamin C available, Quali-C non-GMO vitamin C from Scotland. And our non-GMO sunflower Phospholipid Complex comes from Spain.Benefits Based On Science – We only use Ascorbic Acid (Ascorbate), because that is what scientific evidence shows is vitamin C. Benefits include proper collagen formation for smooth, bright skin, healthy gums, strong bones, joints and blood vessels. Ascorbic Acid also contributes to a strong immune system, normal functioning of the nervous and cardiovascular systems, antioxidant protection of cells from free radicals, stress resilience, energy metabolism, increased iron and calcium absorption.Honesty And Trust – We don’t add up all of the ingredients and call them “Vitamin C Complex” to seem like you’re getting more vitamin C. We combine 1000 mg of Vitamin C with 350 mg of non-GMO phosphatidylcholine complex employing a proprietary manufacturing process that leads to natural liposome formation. It would take more than 2200 mg of “fat soluble” vitamin C to match our dose. This products is non-GMO, Gluten, Soy and Dairy Free, and is made in a cGMP certified facility here in the USA.Liposomal Vitamin C Softgels contain ascorbic acid Vitamin C 1000mg per serving (3 softgels = one serving = 1000 mg,). This liposomal vitamin C is the softgel version of our popular liquid liposomal vitamin C. Softgels are easier to transport and do not require refrigeration like liposomal vitamin c liquid. There is also no flavor with softgels as there is with the liquid version. The high quality of liposomes is achieved by using a refined Phospholipid Complex (PC) derived from non-GMO sunflower lecithin. Our product also contains Quali-C, a form of Scottish Vitamin C, instead of the cheaper Vitamin C other products use. Like liposomal glutathione, vitamin C is essential in maintaining an adequate immune response. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant which protects cells against aging damage caused by free radicals. It provides natural anti-inflammatory support and may assist in lowering melanin production potentially resulting in a whitening effect. In addition, vit C is a critical factor in collagen (skin, bones, ligaments, blood vessels) production. Vitamin C is also a mandatory co-factor in the production of adrenalin for healthy adrenal stress responses and neurotransmission. Vitamin C also assists in the manufacturing of l-carnitine which has lipotropic effects carrying fat into mitochondria for energy production. The Liposomal technology present in this product allows for vitamin C to be encapsulated (trapped) in microscopic protective spheres of essential fats (PC complex) which allow much higher absorption than plain Vitamin C and also decrease stomach irritation. The essential fats are phospholipid “PC complex” molecules which in themselves serve to increase Choline levels and theoretically enhance acetylcholine neurotransmitter levels.

Vitamin D must be taken with adequate amounts of both calcium and magnesium supplementation. When calcium levels are low (due to insufficient vitamin D and calcium intake), the body activates the parathyroid gland, which produces PTH (parathyroid hormone). This hormone kick starts vitamin D hormone production and assists removal of calcium from the banes to be used in more important functions such as neutralizing body acidity.

Beta-Carotene is a red-orange plant pigment that gives vegetables and fruits their rich coloring. The name Beta-Carotene comes from the Greek ""beta"" and Latin ""carota"" (carrot), which is one of the most highly concentrated sources of this antioxidant. The human body converts Beta Carotene and then uses it as Vitamin A, an important essential vitamin. Supplementing with Beta-Carotene: There are many ways to receive Beta-Carotene from supplements such as pills, capsules, powder, liquid, tablets, extracts, creams and gummies. A multivitamin usually contains Vitamin A, but a standalone Beta-Carotene supplement often provides a higher concentration. Looking for a powerful source from a brand you can trust? Horbaach Beta-Carotene: Horbaach Beta-Carotene is a potent source of this beneficial carotenoid. Our gluten-free and non-GMO supplement provides 7,500 mcg (25,000 IU) in each serving from convenient, quick-release softgels.
