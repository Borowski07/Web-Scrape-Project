",     ,"SUPPORT CLEAN & FLEXIBLE BLOOD VESSELS FOR HEALTY CIRCULATION. VesseCLEAR EX is a natural supplement formulated with nattokinase NSK-SD and Elastin F. Nattokinase NSK-SD helps dissolve harmful clots to support clean blood vessels & smooth circulation; while Elastin F helps maintain supple & flexible arteries, especially the aorta which contains ~50% of elastin fibres. Both work in synergy to support healthy blood vessels, blood flow, blood pressure & cardiovascular function.NO. 1 CLINICALLY STUDIED NATTOKINASE NSK-SD - backed by more than 35 studies. NSK-SD is extracted from non-GMO soybeans which were fermented with Bacillus subtilis natto via a patented proprietary process (patents no.: JP3834048, JP3881494), which results in high purity & maximal bioavailability. Developed by JBSL (the pioneer of nattokinase), NSK-SD is recognised by Japan Health and Nutrition Food Association & Japan NattoKinase Association for its authenticity, quality and potency.ENHANCED WITH ELASTIN F. Elastin F is a readily absorbable elastin peptide extracted from bulbus arteriosus (a small chamber that connects gill and heart) of bonito fish via a proprietary enzymatic technology from Japan. Elastin F can be clearly distinguished from elastin derived from fish skin, which has high collagen content. Replenishing the arterial walls with dietary Elastin F helps support the resilience and flexibility of arteries & promotes healthy circulation.SAFE, STABLE & HIGH BIOAVAILABILITY. Nattokinase NSK-SD: supported by human trials & 20 years of safety track record, stable for 42 months at room temperature, nattokinase level significantly increases in blood 2 hours after intake with peak concentration at 13.3 hours. Elastin F: supported by extensive safety studies, stable to heat & acidic condition, readily dissolved in water & easily absorbed in the body.FREE OF PUNGENT SMELL, VITAMIN K2 & PURINE (a risk factor for high uric acid & gout). Nattokinase NSK-SD is standardized to contain 2,000 FU per capsule, which is equivalent to 1 pack (50g) of commercially available natto. Each capsule of VesseCLEAR also contains 75mg Elastin F, a functional dosage to support elasticity of arteries. No wheat, gluten, yeast, milk derivative, preservatives, artificial colouring or flavouring.VesseCLEAR EX is made from 100% pure concentrated nattokinase NSK-SD developed by Japan Bio Science Laboratory, leader and pioneer in nattokinase. It is additionally enhanced with Elastin F (premium quality elastin peptides extracted from the bonito fish, 1000 times more flexible than collagens), research proven to support elastic and supple blood vessels. This formula helps keep blood vessels supple & flexible while ensuring smooth blood circulation. Halal and NSF-certified, nattokinase is an enzyme extracted from non-GMO soybeans which were fermented with a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis natto, via a proprietary process to result in high purity, maximal bioavailability and stability. Nattokinase is scientifically proven to promote healthy blood flow, blood pressure and cardiovascular function by breaking down blood clots, balancing clotting system naturally and normalising blood viscosity.. Helping to prevent arterial stiffness, VesseCLEAR EX (2000 FU per 100mg nattokinase NSK-SD) is also recommended for individuals concerned with heart health, high blood pressure or have a family history or stoke issues.","Nattokinase NSK-SD¬Æ is derived from soybean and some traces of soy may be present in the final product.

It is also absorbed much better than generic K2 MK7Not Like other K2 Supplements - Most K2 supplements contain little to no All-Trans K2. Since the benefits from K2 are derived solely from the All-Trans form many K2 supplements are merely placebos providing little to no benefit.Don't Take Vitamin D3 without All-Trans K2 MK7: Taking D3 without an All-Trans K2 can cause dangerous increases in serum calcium levels and may induce short-term hypercalcemiaMaximum Absorption K2 D3 Vitamin Supplement: Liquid D3 K2 Drops are absorbed better than capsule or softgel alternatives.Made in the USA, Gluten Free, Non Gmo, Third Party Tested; Double Wood's Patented K2 D3 Drops are Made in the USA, contain no gluten, are non-gmo, and Third party tested for purity and potencyVitamin D plays a key role in the immune response. D deficiencies are associated with increased susceptibility to infections. But high dose D3 administration ‚Äì like often suggested beneficial for immune health ‚Äì can induce short‚Äëterm hypercalcemia, a transient increase in serum calcium levels. Although vital for the human body, calcium can have deleterious effects when not properly regulated. Its deposition in blood vessels or other soft tissues, such as elastic fibers in the lungs, can lead to damages. Vitamin K2 activates the calcium‚Äëbinding proteins that prevent calcium deposition in soft tissues and incorporate it to the bone matrix. Several studies have shown vitamin K2, like vitamin D3, to act as an anti‚Äëinflammatory agent by downregulating several metabolic pathways involved in inflammation and cytokine release. Together as the Perfect Pair, vitamins D3 with K2 support healthy immune and inflammatory responses. Double Wood's Patented K2 MK7 drops with D3 are made in the USA, Gluten Free, Non-Gmo, and Third Party tested for Potency. Each bottle is 1Fl Oz and contains 30 servings.

VITAMINS AND MINERALS  Humans must obtain vitamins and minerals from food since our bodies can't produce them. This is why they are also referred to as essential nutrients.  Vitamins are organic compounds made by plants or animals, and minerals are inorganic, existing in soil or water.  Vitamins are necessary for energy production, immune function and other functions. Meanwhile, minerals play  an important role in growth, bone health, fluid balance  and several other processes.  When you eat, you consume the vitamins that plants and animals created or the minerals they absorbed. It's best to eat a variety of foods to get enough vitamins and minerals.
